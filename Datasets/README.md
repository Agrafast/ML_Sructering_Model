# Dataset Description

## Potato
This dataset is taken from Kaggle and consists of 3667 images. This dataset has been divided into three parts, namely training data, validation data, and test data for data processing purposes in the project. 
There are three classes in this dataset, namely:
* Early Blight
* Healthy
* Late Blight

Each class described the condition of potato plants infected with early blight, healthy and late blight. This data will be used as a source of information to develop a machine learning model that can perform automatic classification of potato plant images based on existing classes.

## Rice
This is a link to the rice leaf disease dataset taken from kaggle. A dataset of 2627 images consists of 6 rice leaf diseases in the training folder and validation folder. This data set includes:
* Bacterial Leaf Blight
* Brown Spot
* Healthy
* Leaf Blast
* Leaf Scald
* Narrow Brown Spot

This data will be used as a source of information to develop a machine learning model that can perform automatic classification of rice leaf images based on the type of disease present. It is hoped that this dataset can help improve effectiveness and efficiency in data processing and increase farmers' crop yields.

## Corn
This is a link to the corn leaf disease dataset taken from kaggle. the total amount of data in this dataset is 4,188 images.
This data set includes:
* Common Rust - 1306 images
* Gray Leaf Spot - 574 images
* Blight -1146 images
* Healthy - 1162 images

This dataset will be used as a source of information to develop a machine learning model that can perform automatic classification of corn leaf images based on the type of disease present.
