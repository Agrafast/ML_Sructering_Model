## Machine Learning Structuring

###This repository contains the following folders:
* Datasets
* Models
* Playbooks

## Dataset
This folder contains dataset links from Kaggle that are used for image processing purposes on three types of plants, namely potatoes, rice, and corn.

## Models
This folder contains the implementation of the image processing architecture model which adopts the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) method. This CNN model was built to perform image data processing with the aim of classifying or detecting objects in images. This architectural model was developed by considering various factors such as image size, number of class objects, and the complexity of the image processing process encountered.

## Playbooks
This file contains data in CSV format which contains information about tutorials on planting and treating diseased plants. This data is part of the requirements for running a project, where the data will be used as a source of information for developing machine learning models. It is hoped that the data contained in this file can provide quite complete and accurate information on how to plant and treat diseased plants, so that it can help improve crop quality and reduce farmers' losses due to disease attacks on plants.
